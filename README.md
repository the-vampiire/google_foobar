# Google FooBar Challenges
## On 10/22 at 3:45 am my screen split open during one of my many Python searches...I thought I was being hacked but it was the infamous Google FooBar Challenge! I'm honored to have received it after only coding for 8 months. Hopefully I can make it far enough for an interview. 

## All solutions include my notes and approach details. If you are looking for flawless solutions you have come to the wrong place. I do not have any experience or training in algorithms beyond the Free Code Camp ones so even "classic algorithms solutions" are unknown to me. All the more fun I think - I love solving problems of any sort.
